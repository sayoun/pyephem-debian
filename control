Description: basic astronomical computations for the Python programming language
 PyEphem provides basic astronomical computations for the Python programming
 language. Given a date and location on the Earth's surface, it can compute
 the positions of the Sun and Moon, of the planets and their moons, and of any
 asteroids, comets, or earth satellites whose orbital elements the user can
 provide. Additional functions are provided to compute the angular separation
 between two objects in the sky, to determine the constellation in which an
 object lies, and to find the times at which an object rises, transits, and
 sets on a particular day. The numerical routines that lie behind PyEphem are
 those from the wonderful XEphem astronomy application, whose author, Elwood
 Downey, generously gave permission for us to use them as the basis for PyEphem.
